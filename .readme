Camster Docker Application

This README provides instructions on how to run the Camster Docker application on a Debian-based Linux distribution using USB webcams.

Prerequisites

Docker: Ensure that Docker is installed on your Debian system.

You can install Docker by running the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
Verify the installation:


docker --version
USB Webcams: Ensure that your USB webcams are connected and recognized by the system.

You can check if the webcams are detected by running:


ls /dev/video*
This should list devices like /dev/video0, /dev/video1, etc.

PulseAudio (Optional for Audio Integration):

If you need audio integration with your webcams, you may need to ensure PulseAudio is installed and running. Install it using:


sudo apt install pulseaudio -y
Ensure PulseAudio is running:


pulseaudio --start
Pulling the Docker Image

Open a terminal and pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:


docker pull snarkvader/camster:latest
Running the Docker Container

Create the Bash Script:

Create a new file called run_camster.sh in your desired directory.

Open the file in a text editor and paste the following code:


    #!/bin/bash

    # Start the base command
    cmd="docker run -d \
        --name camster \
        --device /dev/snd \
        --group-add audio \
        -e PULSE_SERVER=unix:${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/pulse/native \
        -v ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/pulse/native:${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/pulse/native \
        -v ~/.config/pulse/cookie:/root/.config/pulse/cookie \
        -p 8000:80"

    # Check if /dev/video0 exists and add it to the command
    if [ -c /dev/video0 ]; then
        cmd="$cmd --device=/dev/video0"
    fi

    # Check if /dev/video1 exists and add it to the command
    if [ -c /dev/video1 ]; then
        cmd="$cmd --device=/dev/video1"
    fi

    # Check if /dev/video2 exists and add it to the command
    if [ -c /dev/video2 ]; then
        cmd="$cmd --device=/dev/video2"
    fi

    # Add the image name at the end of the command
    cmd="$cmd snarkvader/camster:latest"

    # Execute the final command
    eval $cmd


Save the file and close the text editor.


Make the Script Executable:


chmod +x run_camster.sh


Accessing the Application:

Run the Script:

Run the script to start the Docker container:


./run_camster.sh
Open a web browser and navigate to:


http://localhost:8000
This should display the interface for the Camster application.

Stopping and Removing the Container

To stop the running container:


docker stop camster
To remove the container after stopping it:


docker rm camster
Additional Notes

Multiple Webcams: The script automatically detects up to three webcams. If you have more webcams, adjust the script to include additional --device /dev/videoX flags.
Persistent Data: If your application needs to persist data, consider using Docker volumes to map a local directory to a directory inside the container.
Debugging: If you encounter issues, you can access the container’s shell using:

docker exec -it camster /bin/bash
